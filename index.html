      <h3>About Myself</h3>
      <img src=img/picture.jpg>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>I'm a Portland native, born and raised here in the northwest.  I'm a husband to a wonderful woman and proud father of three children.</p>
      <p>For the last four years, I worked as a wafer fab operator for a semiconductor company in the Portland metro area. I was unable to find a career job in my field of study, thus led me to reassess what I wanted out of a career and what I wanted to do in the future.
      <p>Some of my good friends from highschool went on to pursue education in computer science in college. They all work in the tech industry and have their <em>career</em> jobs. One of my friends also runs a small marketing company with his brother, where developing websites is one of the services they provide for their clients. This provided me with a new outlook on what I wanted from a professional career, so I made the decision to go with web developing. Hopefully my skills and background in design will aid me in my pursuit of this goal.

      <h4>Education</h4>
      <p>I attended Benson Polytechnic High School in Portland where I majored in computer science, which may have been my first foray into a code based environment. I then studied Architecture and graduated from Portland State University in 2010.</p>

      <h4>Hobbies</h4>
      <p>I like living in Oregon and I wouldn't have it any different. I enjoy hiking in the gorge and fishing in Oregon's bountiful lakes, rivers, and streams. I'm an <em>avid</em> car enthusiast, part of a local car club and race gokarts with my fellow gearheads. I'm a natural artist, but lack formal art education and technique. I make up for this with the ability to translate ideas visually with pencil and paper. Photography is also something that I enjoy doing on my free time, but I'm probably <em>amateur</em> at best.</p>
      <h4>Skills</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>10-key <em>proficient</em></li>
        <li>Sketching</li>
        <li>Drafting</li>
        <li>Photoshop</li>
        <li>Illustrator</li>
        <li>Google SketchUP</li>
        <li>AutoCAD</li>
